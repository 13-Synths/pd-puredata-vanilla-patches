#X text 45 17 This is the first version of the 'analyse' object. If
you click on the 'snapshot' button an analysis is sent to the third
outlet. The spectrum is analysed and for every harmonic the frequency
and amplitude are given (beginning with the loudest and ending with
the softest harmonic). This analysis from outlet 3 can be sent to the
additive synthesizer in abunch 'addy' and the frequencies and amplitudes
of this synthesizer will be set to the analysis results. The ground
frequency (the main pitch) is printed in the main Pd window.;
#X text 45 193 At the moment 'analyse' is based on the 'sigmund' object
of Miller Puckette (if you want more information about this object
