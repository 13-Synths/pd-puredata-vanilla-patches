#X text 48 22 With the 'presets' object you can store the position
of faders \, knobs \, ... and the opened sound files in abunch objects
(like play-sample or play-file). You have to give a name to the presets
object. When you create a new object \, type 'presets' ( \, a tab)
and a name. This name should be no longer than one word \, for example
"presets file1".;
#X text 205 205 = with this number box you fix the number of the preset
that you want to open or store.;
#X text 199 240 = click on this button to store a preset (with the
number of the number box "number_preset". Take care: if there is already
a preset with the same number \, this (older) preset will be overwritten!

#X text 61 906 Take care: presets stores the path on your computer
where the sound files are. If you move the used sound files or if you
want to open the presets on an other computer (where the sound files
are somewhere else or simply missing) a message will appear in the
Pd main window saying that the sound files can't be found.;

'save_preset'.;
#X text 198 446 = if you click this button \, all (abunch) files that
are necessary to make the (opened) main patch work \, will be printed
in the Pd main window. Unfortunately it isn't possible to know the
name of an opened file in Pd so '(this opened file)' in the printout
refers to the name of the main file.;
#X text 64 797 A (harmless) bug: if you enter a presets object with
a new name (like 'presets set2') in a file and no presets have been
saved yet with this name \, a message like 'error: file set2.txt doesn't
exist' will appear in the Pd main window. Just ignore this bug and
save your first preset with the new name...;
#X text 65 730 All presets are stored in the folder abunch/presets.
They are saved as a txt-file (called 'set1.txt' if you created the
object 'presets set1').;
