#X text 239 197 Chose the envelope that you want to use. The name of
the chosen envelope is shown in the box under this row of buttons.
The faders that aren't needed for the chosen envelope are white.;
#X text 65 280 A short explanation about all the envelopes that you
can chose from:;
#X text 65 324 vad-envelope = attack \, decay envelope (only note-on
needed \, not sensitive to velocity);
#X text 65 369 vad-hold-envelope = attack \, hold \, decay envelope
(the sustained part has a duration fixed by the hold duration (only
note-on needed \, not velocity sensitive);
#X text 59 419 adsr-envelope = attack \, decay \, sustain release envelope
\, not sensitive to the velocity. 'Sustain' is the percentage of the
peak value \, used as velocity of the sustained part (note-on and note-off
needed);
#X text 59 487 adsr-velocity-sensitive-envelope = like envelope 3 but
the velocity determines the value of the peak and sustain is the percentage
of the incoming velocity used as velocity for the sustained part. (note-on
and note-off needed);
#X text 54 556 adr-velocity-as-sustain-envelope = attack \, decay \,
release envelope. The value of attack is the incoming velocity multiplied
by 'peak' \, the incoming velocity is the sustain value (note-on and
note-off needed);
#X text 56 635 adr-hold-retrigger-envelope = like envelope 5 but with
a hold time (ms). This envelope is better suited for fast retriggers
\, the attack is the time between the amplitude of the ended note and
the peak of the next note. (only note-on neeeded);
#X text 51 724 ad-envelope-quartic = attack \, decay envelope with
an exponential curve between the attack and decay (only note-on needed)
;
#X text 51 779 ad-envelope-linear = attack \, decay envelope with a
linear curve between the attack and decay (only note-on needed);
#X text 51 825 adsr-velocity-quartic-envelope = like envelope 5 but
with exponential curves between the attack \, sustain and release;
#X text 57 53 With the 'envelopes' object you can use different (amplitude)
envelopes to cut a fragment out of a sound stream.;
#X text 240 899 If this toggle is on (crossed) \, a note-on velocity
with value 100 is sent to the envelope. If this toggle is turned off
a 0 (note-off) is sent. (Take care: some envelopes only need a note-on
while others need both note-on and note-off values.;

the peak value.;
#X text 192 1099 Use this to change the time (in milliseconds) to go
from the peak value to the sustain value.;
#X text 189 1147 This fader changes the duration (in milliseconds)
of the sustain;
#X text 130 1417 (audio) inlet for the sound from which a envelope
will be cut;
#X text 128 1459 (event) inlet for the velocity values \, this value
controls the toggle go(note-on_note-off);
#X text 131 1506 (event) inlet to control the fader 'peak';
#X text 129 1531 (event) inlet to control the fader 'attack';
#X text 129 1551 (event) inlet to control the fader 'decay';
#X text 129 1571 (event) inlet to control the fader 'hold';
#X text 129 1588 (event) inlet to control the fader 'sustain';
#X text 129 1606 (event) inlet to control the fader 'release';
#X text 129 1638 (audio) outlet of the sound with an envelope;
#X text 129 1672 (audio) outlet of the envelope signal (the ramp) (for
example use this in connection with o-scope to see the envelope);
#X text 185 1002 You can change the peak value with this fader. Value
1.2 means that the peak value is 1.2 times the incoming velocity.;
#X text 191 1199 Depending on the envelope that you choose \, this
fader changes the sustained value (0 to 127 \, like the velocity) or
the percentage (0 to 100) of the incoming velocity.;
#X text 196 1263 Use this to change the release time \, this is the
time between the note-off or the end of the hold time and the end of
the sound.;
