#X text 16 10 You can play or perform with any fader or knob in an
abunch object using the computer mouse. But you can also control this
faders externally and make them move automatically. Most of the faders
and knobs have an inlet (in the abunch object) to which you can send
values to control that specific knob or fader. In the help file of
the abunch object -in the section called 'inlets'- you can find information
about which inlet to use for a certain fader.;
#X text 14 151 In this example you can change the pitch in 'waves'
(fader 'pitch') using the mouse. You can also click on 'start/reset'
in 'timeline' and the values of the table in 'timeline' will be sent
to the 'pitch' fader in 'waves' (because inlet 3 of 'timeline' is the
inlet to control this fader).;
#X text 36 409 <1> Open preset 1 (there is only 1 preset);
#X text 33 434 <2> Open 'waves' and change the value of the fader 'pitch'
;
#X text 33 459 <3> Open 'timeline' and click on 'start/reset' \, from
now on the 'pitch' fader in 'waves' change automatically.;
#X text 14 522 To control a parameter in an abunch object you have
to send values between 0 and 127 (just as in MIDI). All control objects
(like 'timeline' or 'sequencer') and control inlets are adjusted to
this range \, so it should be easy to connect abunch objects with each
other.;
