# pd-puredata-vanilla-patches

collection of public pure data vanilla abstractions / patches found on internet.<br>

> Pure Data is a incredibly popular tool for audio/visual/data-manipulation. It's kindof MAX/MSP, but it can also run on your fridge-hardware.

DISCLAIMER: I did not write these patches. I was searching the net for free
vanilla patches in order to use with pure data (vanilla) / pdlib/mobmuplat.
I figured it would be handy to create a (unix greppable) pd candyshop, in contrast to searching the web all the time.<br>
Also, it might be convenient for others too, to put it out here on github.

# DISCLAIMER

PD is highly addictive, sound- and logical programming-wise <BR>
Therefore, I cannot be held responsible for you losing hours / days / weeks to patch-fiddling ;)
