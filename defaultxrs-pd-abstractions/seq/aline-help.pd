#X text 181 51 aline is basically just an abstraction for line that
automatically turns floats into ramp messages. in other words \, sending
a float to the left inlet will not make the line "jump" to that value
\; the line will ramp to that value over the amount of time provided
as the first argument (or to the right inlet).;
#X text 177 137 note that there is no loss of functionality if you
use this! you can still send a pair of numbers to the left inlet to
set the destination value and the ramp time simultaneously. thus \,
you can still make the internal line jump to a value by sending a message
like "5 0" to jump to the number 5 in 0 milliseconds.;
