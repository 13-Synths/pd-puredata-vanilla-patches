#X text 350 135 inputn - input accumulator for numbers;
#X text 335 194 this is similar to [input] \, except that it is only
for numbers. you can build up a number (even negative numbers or numbers
with decimal points) by sending keynames to the inlet. right now \,
[inputn] is pretty dumb in that it doesn't prevent you from putting
more than one decimal point or from putting the dash in places where
it doesn't make sense. therefore \, you'll have to be careful and watch
pd's console window for any errors.;
#X text 334 307 also \, take note that the left outlet outputs a symbol
\, NOT a float. that's because if it outputted floats \, you wouldn't
be able to tell if you had entered a period or dash until then next
number you input.;
#X text 342 392 ...so obviously there are a lot of things i could improve
in this abstraction.;
