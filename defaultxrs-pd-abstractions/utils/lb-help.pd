#X text 215 134 basically lb is the same as [loadbang] \, but you can
provide a number as an argument and it will output that number instead
of a bang.;
#X text 219 195 also \, if you provide a second argument \, the second
argument will be output instead of the first if the first is zero.
this is useful if you use a dollar-sign value (like \$1) as the first
argument: you can then provide a "default" value for if the dollar-sign
value is zero (which is the default value of an argument that isn't
provided. be careful with this \, though \, since the user might actually
provide 0 as an argument \, in which case the second argument of lb
would be used instead of what the user specified! :( if you don't understand
this paragraph \, then just don't use that feature.);
